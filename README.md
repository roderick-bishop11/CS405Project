# Problem

Remembering birthdays is one of the best ways to show a person that you care for them, but too many people forget. Forgetting is something most humans do almost daily, we canâ€™t blame them for forgetting but we also want to remember to celebrate those that we love the most. The world needs a solution to this issue and help others show they care with one of the most accepted acts of love humans can offer.


# Solution
We propose a chrome extension that will allow users to add birthdays for people that they know and get notifications when their birthday is arriving. 

# Tech Stack
For this project, we plan to use React.js.
