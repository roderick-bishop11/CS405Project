# Problem

Remembering birthdays is one of the best ways to show a person that you care for them, but too many people forget. The world needs a solution to this issue and help others show they care with one of the most accepted acts of love humans can offer. 


# Solution
We propose a webapp that will allow users to add birthdays for people that they know and get notifications when their birthday is arriving. 

# Tech Stack

So far, all we know is that We'll be using vanilla JS for our webapp
