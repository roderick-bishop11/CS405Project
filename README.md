# Problem
Remembering birthdays is one of the best ways to show a person that you care for them, but too many people forget. Forgetting is something most humans do almost daily, we can’t blame them for forgetting but we also want to remember to celebrate those that we love the most. The world needs a solution to this issue and help others show they care with one of the most accepted acts of love humans can offer.


# Solution
We propose a chrome extension or web app that will allow users to add birthdays for people that they know and get notifications when their birthday is arriving. 


# Tech Stack
For this project, we plan to use React.js.
